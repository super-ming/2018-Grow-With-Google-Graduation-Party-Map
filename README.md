## 2018 Udacity Grow With Google Scholarship Graduation Events

This application uses Google Maps API to display upcoming graduation events that are organized by fellow graduates
of the Grow with Google Scholarship program.

Over the last 9 months, students from across the United States worked to advance their career and complete a Nanodegree. We made it!

In the beginning, 50,000 students were chosen to participate in the Challenge Course. Then it was narrowed down to the top 5%.

Thanks to all of the scholars who stepped up to organize the events! 

DISCLAIMER: This event is a privately sponsored event organized by students or alumni in our community and is not an official Udacity event of any kind.
